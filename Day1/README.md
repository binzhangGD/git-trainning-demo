## ðŸ“Ž What is a Git repository ?
- a folder that is being tracked by your Git server
- it is a version controlled folder
- Git tracks all changes done to files/folder within the repository
- the history/version of changes done to files/folders within the repository are tracked by Git

## ðŸ“Ž What is a Version Control System (VCS) ?


## ðŸ“Ž What is a Local Version Control System (LVCS) ?
- you could install some Local Version Control system on your laptop/desktop

### Advantages
- only you will have access to your code repository
- you will have unrestricted access to your code repository
- you could work offline

### Disadvantages
- multiple team members can't collaborate
- single point failure, in case your code repository gets corrupted due to OS crash or some issue on your local system, the entire will be lost

## ðŸ“Ž What is a Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) ?
- client/server architecture
- The CVCS software is installed on a Centralized Physical Server that is accessible to all team members within an Organization
- Each Team members that works in a project will have some kind of client software installed on their local laptop/desktop

## Advantages
- could control access to the source code repository, i.e different users having different types of access
- helps multiple team members work in a source code repository simultaneously

## Drawbacks
- Single point of failure, i.e your centralized server goes down or there is a network outage
- can't work offline

## ðŸ“Ž What is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) ?
- it doesn't follow client/server architecture

- Examples
  - Git/GitHub,etc
 
#### Advantages
- all benefits of CVCS is there in DVCS too
- we could work offline without any need for network/internet
- supports working offline, pretty much all Git features all possible in a disconnected mode
- the only time we need to be connected to the remote GitHub server is either you wish to pull latest changes from remote server to local or when you wish merge your changes done locally to the remote server
